                , and I am running for the Minnesota House of Representatives in

                <strong className="text-campaign-blue">leadership</strong>
                
                . I
                learned early that real change does not come from talking about
                communities. <strong className="text-campaign-blue">It comes from standing with them and doing the

              <p>
                I have spent years {''} <strong className="text-campaign-blue "> organizing, building coalitions, and serving in leadership roles </strong>  that put me at the intersection of community and government. I have worked inside city systems and alongside residents, {' '} <strong className="text-campaign-blue">  helping turn ideas into action and making sure everyday people have a voice in decisions that affect their lives. </strong> Those experiences taught me how policy is made and how it should be made.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am a young leader, but I am not new to responsibility.

              </p>
              <p>
                I am running because {' '} <strong className="text-campaign-blue"> District 65B </strong>  deserves representation that {' '} <strong className="text-campaign-blue"> listens, leads, and delivers. </strong> This campaign is about building a future where {' '}<strong className="text-campaign-blue"> every neighborhood is valued, every voice matters, and the next generation can see themselves in the people fighting for them at the Capitol. </strong>
